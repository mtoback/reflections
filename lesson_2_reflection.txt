What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a holding area to allow you to "freeze" files in anticipation of committing them. That is to say, no one can change them, but no one else can see them either. If you decide that you need to make further changes before commmitting you can do that, but no one else can see those either.
